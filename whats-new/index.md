## {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} platform
{: #platform_category}

### Protect your service IDs and API keys
New as of: 1 June 2018

To avoid a situation where your service ID or API key is deleted causing an outage or disruption, you have the option to lock service IDs and API keys by using the UI or CLI. Locking a service ID also prevents any access policies from being changed, deleted, or assigned as well as any API keys associated with the service ID from being created or deleted. For more information, see [Locking a service ID](/docs/iam/serviceid.html#locking-a-service-id) and [Locking an API key](/docs/iam/userid_keys.html#locking-an-api-key).

### Upgrade your Lite account to a Subscription account
New as of: 31 May 2018

You can now upgrade your Lite account to a Subscription account directly from the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console. With a Subscription account, you can use both platform and infrastructure offerings, and take advantage of discounted pricing by making a monthly spending and term commitment. You can also avoid surprises with fixed billing on a monthly payment schedule, but with the flexibility to order more or less based on your needs. For more information, see [Subscription account FAQS](/docs/billing-usage/billing-faq.html#subscription-faqs). 

### {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} CLI rebranding
New as of: 15 May 2018

The {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} CLI commands have changed from `bluemix` and `bx` to **ibmcloud**. However, you can still use the `bluemix` and `bx` CLI commands until they are removed at a later date. There is no short name at this time, just the full name **ibmcloud**. 

### Multi-factor authentication for your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} account
New as of: 02 May 2018

Multi-factor authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security to your account by requiring all users to provide a time-based one-time passcode in addition to their standard IBMid and password during log in. This is also commonly known as two-factor authentication (2FA). MFA is enabled per account, and once it is turned on, all users in the account are required to log in using the additional security measure.

For more information, see the [IBM Cloud Platform now adds support for Multi-Factor Authentication](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2018/05/ibm-cloud-platform-now-adds-support-multi-factor-authentication/){: new_window} ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon") blog post.

### Assign access quickly by using access groups
New as of: 03 April 2018

Do you want to be able to assign access quickly by using the least amount of policies possible? Now you can with access groups. Access groups enable you to group a set of users and service IDs together and assign a single policy that applies to all members of the group. By using access groups, you can limit the time you spend managing access to the users and service IDs in your account. Check out the blog post [New feature: Access groups](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2018/04/access-groups/){: new_window} ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon") for more details.

### SoftLayer and {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} account linking
New as of:  01 March 2018

You can link your SoftLayer account to your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} account to log in to a single location, the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console, and access both infrastructure as a service (IaaS) and platform as a service (PaaS) resources. If you're new to {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}, create and link an account to get a free {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Lite account. Or, if you already have an {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} account with PaaS resources, link your accounts to receive a single bill for both your IaaS and PaaS resources. Check out [Steps to Link your IaaS and PaaS Accounts](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2018/03/follow-steps-link-iaas-paas-accounts/){: new_window} ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon") to quickly link your accounts.


### {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Foundry Service US East region is now available
New as of:  15 December 2017

A new US East data center is now available in Washington, DC. This new region can be reached using the `us-east.bluemix.net` endpoint. For details on the services that are available for purchase in this new region, see [Services by region](/docs/services/services_region.html#services_region).

### Support for resources in the European Union
New as of: 14 December 2017

If your services and data centers are located in Europe, {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} now offers additional capabilities to protect your data in the European Union. You can request support be provided by customer success teams that are located in Europe. This support is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

### Withdrawal of support for TLS 1.0 and 1.1
New as of: 28 November 2017

On 1 March 2018 {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} will withdraw support for TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 across many of our cloud products and services as part of our commitment to offering a cloud that is secure to the core and in alignment with industry best practices for security and data privacy. To learn more about how this change affects you and what actions you might need to take, see [Withdrawal of support for TLS 1.0 and 1.1](/docs/troubleshoot/appsectls.html).

### A new way to organize resources within your account
New as of: 16 November 2017

Resource groups are a new way for you to create customizable groupings of account resources, and access to the group and the resources within it are managed by using Identity and Access Management (IAM). Everyone starts out with a default resource group. You can rename this resource group and add new service intances to it as you create them from the catalog.

For users with a Pay-As-You-Go or Subscription account, you can create additional resource groups to make managing quota and viewing billing usage for a set of resources easier. You can also group resources to make it easier for you to assign users access to more than one service at a time. To learn more about working with resource groups for your account, see [Managing resource groups](/docs/account/resourcegroups.html#rgs).

### Updates for {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} IAM
New as of: 16 November 2017

The introduction of [resource groups](/docs/overview/resource-groups.html#whatis) within your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} account has opened up a new way for you to assign access. Users and service IDs can be assigned access to all services within a resource group enabling you to quickly assign access to more than one resource at a time. You can also customize access for each user or service ID by assigning access to just some services within a resource group, or you just choose to assign access to individual resources down to the service instance level.

For more information about the features that you can take advantage of by using IAM, see [What features does IAM provide?](/docs/iam/index.html#features)

### Customize your dashboard view
New as of: 16 November 2017

You can view and manage all the resources in your account from your dashboard in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console. And now, you can set filters to customize your view. For example, you can filter by resource group to view the specific resources in a resource group. You can also filter by region or Cloud Foundry space. For more details, see [Managing resources on the dashboard](/docs/overview/ui.html#dashboardview).


### Support Center
New as of: 2 November 2017

We now have the new Support Center where you can search for information, post questions to our developer community, and manage tickets. Go to **Support > Support Center** in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console menu bar.

### Introducing IBM Cloud
New as of: 31 October 2017

Bluemix is now IBM Cloud. Besides rolling out our new name, nothing changes. You can still easily build and run your apps and services as always. Check out the [IBM Cloud Blog](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2017/10/bluemix-is-now-ibm-cloud/){: new_window} ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon") for more details.

### Lite account
New as of: 31 October 2017

A Lite account is our new account type that gives you access to try select services for free with no time restrictions. This new account also includes usage tracking and efficiency features to help you better manage your resources. To learn more about what's available, see [Account types](/docs/account/index.html#liteaccount).

### Identity and Access Management application authentication feature
New as of: 6 October 2017

Identity and Access Management (IAM) now provides the ability to create a Service ID, which you can think of as an identity that can be used for apps to authenticate with your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} services. Instead of using individual user credentials, a Service ID can be created with an associated API key and access permissions in the form of a service policy that is assigned to the Service ID in order for you to control the level of access for any application authenticating with that ID.

For more information about the benefits of this feature and how to get started, see the [Introducing IBM Cloud IAM Service IDs and API Keys](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2017/10/introducing-ibm-cloud-iam-service-ids-api-keys/){: new_window} ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon").

### {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} global catalog
New as of: 27 July 2017

Expanding on the last console update to manage your public regions from a single location in the console, {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} now has a global catalog making the process of selecting and deploying items you select from the catalog a more streamlined process. Regardless of the region you have selected in the console, you can now see all services that are available across all public regions from your catalog. Once you select a tile from the catalog, you can see which regions the service is available in, and select where you want to deploy it.

For more information about the latest updates to the catalog, see [A global {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} catalog makes building things easier](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2017/07/global-bluemix-catalog-makes-building-things-easier/){: new_window} ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon").

### {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console updates
New as of: 23 May 2017

For more information about this update, check out [New Global Bluemix UI for Higher Availability and More](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2017/05/new-global-bluemix-ui-higher-availability/){: new_window} ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon").

### Identity and access management
New as of: 01 May 2017

With the latest updates and improvements, {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} account owners or administrators can now use a new unified access control UI to take advantage of the following capabilities:
 * Manage users' fine-grained access to Kubernetes services and other services as they adopt the new access control features
 * Assign service policies and Cloud Foundry roles to users within their organizations

Additionally, {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} platform users can create, delete, and list API keys associated with their user IDs. And platform users can use those API keys to authenticate when using APIs or CLIs.

Lastly, we’ve enhanced our unified user management capability to ensure that in a linked IaaS-PaaS account, users are managed in a unified way with no need to add users separately in the SoftLayer Customer Portal or the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console.

For more information about the recent update, check out the [Introducing Identity & Access Management](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2017/05/introducing-identity-access-management/){: new_window} ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon") blog post.

### February updates for the administration console
{: #febadminconsole}
New as of: 28 February 2018

With the latest update from February 2018, you can use the following new feature:

#### New permission for managing maintenance updates

A new user permission has been introduced to specifically allow users to approve and reschedule maintenance updates, as well as to set up maintenance update windows that stipulate when maintenance updates can be deployed into a dedicated environment.
See the [video demonstration](https://youtu.be/7c7jyp_JJWU){: new_window} ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon") for more information.

### December updates for the administration console
{: #decemberadminconsole}
New as of: 14 December 2017

With the latest updates and improvements from December, you can use the following new features:

#### Subscribe to notifications for average CPU usage threshold

Average CPU has been added as a threshold type in notification subscriptions. You can now receive notifications when CPU usage (averaged across all DEA's and Diego Cells) goes above or below a certain threshold.

#### Control access to cloud systems in the European Union

Combined with the new capability in the European Union to support cloud resources (starting with Frankfurt), the administration console now has the capability to define policies that control access by IBM personnel. You can manage access control policies, view access requests, take action on the requests, and track the history.

#### Enhanced information in security reports

Security reports now include user-friendly names in addition to unique IDs for users and organizations.

### August updates for the administration console
{: #augustadminconsole}
New as of: 31 August 2017

With the latest updates and improvements from August, you can use the following new features:

#### Updates to {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} service usage metrics

  * The computation of usage metrics for {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} has been updated to reflect the total amount of GBs used and available across all nodes in a {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} cluster. Typically, a {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} cluster contains 3 nodes, and a document in the database is replicated across all the nodes in the cluster for high-availability and disaster recovery. With the August updates, the capacity metric in the {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} dial (available in the _Resource Usage > Services_ view) indicates the space across all the nodes in the cluster. For example, if a single {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} cluster contains 3 nodes, each with 1000 GB capacity, the capacity limit will be 3000 GB. If 1500 GBs of that capacity have been used, the {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} usage metric will be 50%.

#### Updates to the scheduling of maintenance updates

  * In {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_dedicated_notm}}, customers can manage the dates and times when their dedicated environments are available for deployment of system updates. Customers can define availability windows representing dates and times when maintenance updates can and cannot be deployed to their Dedicated environment. In the August update, _Available Update Windows_ have been renamed _Update Windows_, and _Unavailable Update Windows_ have been renamed _Blackout Windows_. Beyond the terminology changes, customers now have more flexibility and margin for defining blackout (unavailable) dates. Once requested, blackout dates will require IBM approval, and the time it takes to gain approval will vary. When the requested blackout dates are approved, IBM will cancel any existing updates that are currently scheduled during the unavailable window. IBM will also create new records for these updates and schedule them outside the approved blackout dates.

See the [video demonstration](https://bit.ly/2eCQNvu){: new_window} ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon") for more information.

### July updates for the administration console
{: #julyadminconsole}
New as of: 31 July 2017

#### Updates to resource usage history capabilities

  * In the previous update (June), the History view for memory and disk usage had introduced display of usage data over the last 48 hours, 30 days, and 5 mohths. In this latest July update, the resource usage history functionality has been expanded to allow customization of the time span for which to show resource usage data. Hourly, daily and monthly views remain, but users can now specify a start day/time and duration for which to display memory and disk usage metrics (for example, showing memory usage for 15 days starting on July 1st 2017).
  * A new CLI command has been introduced to display resource metrics history in the CLI. The parameters of the command, as well as usage examples can be found by typing the following: `_cf ba resource-metrics-history -help_`

### {{site.data.keyword.streaminganalyticsshort}} service updates: Develop Streams applications in your Python development environment
New as of: 13 April 2017

In the past, you had to install a local version of IBM Streams to develop Python applications. That’s no longer the case. Now you can develop applications with Python in your favorite development environment or in a Jupyter interactive notebook.

You can use the STREAMING_ANALYTICS_SERVICE context to submit a Python application to the {{site.data.keyword.streaminganalyticsshort}} service. The {{site.data.keyword.streaminganalyticsshort}} service requires Python 3.5.

You can create sample Python applications using Jupyter notebooks in IBM Data Science Experience (DSX), and submit these applications to the {{site.data.keyword.streaminganalyticsshort}} instance directly from DSX. Check out the sample stream-processing Python applications in notebooks on the [DSX community page](https://datascience.ibm.com/){: new_window} ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon").
